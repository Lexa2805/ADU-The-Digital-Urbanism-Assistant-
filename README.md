ADU – Digital Urbanism Assistant
Intelligent Triage System (Version 2.1)
1. Project Name

ADU – Digital Urbanism Assistant

2. Problem Statement (Dual Perspective)
For Citizens

Urbanism procedures are slow, opaque, and frustrating.
Common issues include long queues, unclear requirements, repeated trips to the city hall, and a high rate of rejections caused by simple formal mistakes.

For Municipality Employees

Over 60% of work time is wasted on repetitive, low-value tasks:

Manual triage

Data entry

Formal checks

Document verification

Employees spend more time acting as “operators” than urban planning analysts.

3. The Solution (Advanced & Consolidated)

ADU is an intelligent platform built on Google Gemini API, acting as a 24/7 digital urbanism officer.
Its purpose is to deliver fully validated and pre-processed files to municipal staff, ready for real analysis.

Core Pillars
1. Domain Intelligence (RAG)

ADU is trained on local legislation:

Law 50/1991

Local PUG & PUZ documents

Urban rules specific to the city

It provides legally accurate, context-aware guidance.

2. API-First Integration

ADU works as an intelligent middleware between the citizen and existing municipal systems:

Document Management System

Registry software

GIS/urban planning datasets

Automatically pre-populates fields in internal systems through API integration.

4. How It Works (Detailed Workflow)
Step 1: Intelligent Guidance (Chatbot + RAG + GIS)

The citizen selects a location on the map.

The Gemini-powered chatbot understands the intent (e.g., “I want to close my balcony”).

It queries the local PUG for that specific zone and generates a 100% accurate checklist.

✔ Problem solved: No more triage at the counter.

Step 2: Instant Formal Validation

Citizens upload their documents.
ADU (Gemini 1.5 Pro) performs visual and metadata analysis:

Example:
✗ ERROR: Your ID card expired on 01.01.2024.

✔ Problem solved: No more incomplete or invalid files reach the municipality.

Step 3: Cross-Document Content Validation

ADU reads and compares information across documents:

Example:
✗ WARNING: Name in request (“Popa Ion”) does not match ownership document (“Popa Ioan”).

✔ Problem solved: Minor content inconsistencies are detected automatically.

Step 4: Automated Extraction & System Integration (API-First)

ADU extracts structured data (Name, CNP, Cadastral Number, etc.) and sends it directly to the municipality’s internal registry system.

✔ Problem solved: Manual data entry is eliminated (100%).

Step 5: Intelligent Triage for Municipal Staff (New)

After validation, files are automatically prioritized in the staff dashboard:

Categorized by AI (e.g., Balcony Closure, House Extension)

Ordered by deadlines and importance

✔ Problem solved: Employees know exactly what is urgent and avoid manual workload organization.

5. User Ecosystem & Impact

Clear requirements

Zero unnecessary trips or rejections due to formal errors

For Municipality Employees

6. Summary

ADU transforms the urbanism workflow by replacing repetitive manual checks with an intelligent, automated validation engine.
It brings transparency, speed, and efficiency for all actors involved—citizens, municipal staff, and architects.
